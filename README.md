# Julia tutorials

A collection of Jupyter notebooks showing typical tasks that can be done with ```julia```. It include such things as Linear algebra, plots and graphics, numerical solution of nonlinear equations, numerical integration of ordinary differential equations, Montecarlo problems and numerical integration of Stochastic differential equations.

The notebooks can be viewed as static web pages in the repository, however there is a [binder image]https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Miguel-ASM/myBinder-Julia-env/master) of the repository that allows to experiment (run/edit/modify) with the notebooks without installing any software in your computer.

This badge ([![Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Miguel-ASM/myBinder-Julia-env/master)) is a link to the [binder image](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Miguel-ASM/myBinder-Julia-env/master).




## The collection of notebooks

#### Basic Jupyter & julia stuff

#### Algebra

#### Plots

#### Differential equations

In this section I will be using a lot the package [```DifferentialEquations.jl```](https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/index.html), which has a really nice collection of methods to model and simulate systems governed by differential equations. Complete guides and documentation can be found [*here*](https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/index.html). The git-hub repo is [*here*](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
